## Multi Chrono: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Multi Chrono app for Android!

This Android application is a simple chronometer for multiple athletes at the same time.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
